PREFACE.


It is not necessary to speak many words in praise of such an excellent
book as “Lakeland Words,” it speaks for itself, and must appeal to any
and every Englishman who loves his country and his native mother tongue.

It has often been said that the vocabulary of the ordinary rustic is
but poor and scanty, and it is just such books as Mr. Kirkby’s which
show how entirely false this statement is. Mr. Kirkby, besides, is
not a mere collector, come down from London with his carpet bag to
spend a few weeks in the north to pick up material for “copy,” but
he has been born and bred in the country of which he writes, and he
knows and understands the dialect as no one from outside could. I have
had innumerable proofs of this from the vast amount of most valuable
material he has contributed to the English Dialect Dictionary. There
is a freshness and naturalness in his material which is not found in
books written by people imperfectly acquainted with the people and the
district.

In these days when the Board Schools teach the children “Standard
English,” and when locomotion is so easy that people readily migrate
from one part of the country to another, dialects are rapidly decaying
and losing their individuality, and it will soon be impossible to
compile local glossaries. It is, therefore, not too much to say that
Mr. Kirkby deserves the hearty commendation and thanks of every lover
of English, for thus handing down to posterity such a faithful portrait
of the language of the Lakeland district, in all its native freshness
and richness.

  OXFORD, JANUARY, 1899.


“Man changes his dialect from century to century.”
                                                _Carlyle._




“Language is a solemn thing I said. It grows out of life—out of its
agonies, and ecstacies, its wants and its weariness. Every language
is a temple in which the soul of those who speak it is enshrined....
Foreigners who have talked a strange tongue half their lives return
to the language of their childhood in their dying hours. Gentlemen in
fine linen, and scholars in large libraries, taken by surprise, or in
a careless moment, will sometimes let slip a word they knew as boys in
homespun, and have not spoken since that time, but it lay there under
all their culture. That is one way you may know the country boys.”....
                                             _Oliver Wendell Holmes._




EXPLANATORY.


The following pages claim to do no more than to set forth some of our
best known dialect words, and to somewhat explain or illustrate their
use by a sentence in which the word is introduced. So may not only
the word be preserved, but something also of unity of expression be
maintained at the same time.

Much of the matter has gone through the pages of the _Penrith
Observer_, in the form of weekly notes. These notes were subject to
some criticism. They were the means of eliciting a good deal of help
towards making the collection more complete and accurate.

The method of spelling was frequently commented upon as involving an
unnecessary innovation. A short explanation will, it is hoped, enable
the reader to grasp it. Take such words as _face_, _race_, _place_,
with the long _a_. We pronounce them as _fi_ + _as_, _ri_ + _as_,
_pli_ + _as_, with a short _i_ sound, and the _a_ short as in _as_.
Words like _master_, _plaster_, become _maister_, _plaister_, with the
_a_ sounded as in _pay_. The long _o_ sound is a pet aversion. _Home_
becomes _hi_ + _am_, _boat_ as if it were _boo_ + _at_, _poke_ takes
the form of _poo_ + _ak_. Such words as _post_ prove our consistency
and cause many a one to get laughed at for the hasty _o_ we assign it
just as if it were _copy_.

The deep sound of _oo_ shows our perversity. For _ow_ we give it place
every time, _hoo_, _thoo_, _doon_, _noo_, _coo_, and just as readily
depose it from its legitimate place in _boot_, _soot_, _nook_, _book_,
which in turn become _bi_ + _ut_, _si_ + _ut_, _ni_ + _uk_, _bi_ +
_uk_. _Go_, _going_, _gone_, we make into _ga_ (when short), _gah_,
_gahn_, _gi_ + _an_, and in some extreme instances almost _garn_.
Final _ing_ is too affected for us, so we drop it and substitute _en_.
_Quiet_ we quietly convert into _whiat_, because _q_ is a pet aversion
in all places with us. To give a hint as to the cause of this does not
come within our scope. But no one can come closely into contact with
the dialect without being struck with this aspect of it. A word like
_hope_ we evade or turn it into _hooap_ or _whop_, yet _daup_, _cauf_,
_mope_, _crope_, show that we can master the sound if we wish, and
stick to it. If we will not say _blue_ except as _blew_, we make up
for it in _hoo_ and _noo_. If the _r_ is our aversion, we can, as few
others can, say _faddr_, _muddr_, _cluddr_.

Having banished the _ow_ sound from most of its legitimate places in
the language, we put it in by way of amends where we can by “any manner
o’ means” do so. Thus we have _bowt_ for _bolt_ and _bought_; _browt_
for _brought_; _bowster_ for _bolster_; _cowt_ for _colt_; _thowt_ for
_thought_; _dowter_ for _daughter_; and so on.

In the present work no attempt is made to explain or account for
anything of a peculiar character in the dialect. If language grows
out of life, we are justified in regarding ours as a type, and those
who are most familiar with the life out of which it has grown, will
be most likely those to regard it most leniently. They will know
something of the social habits which the fair and market, the smithy
hearth, the shoemaker’s shop are dominating factors in forming. They
will understand what it is to be concerned with cattle, and the
elements, as others are with more mighty affairs. Out of the exigencies
of ploughing, sowing, reaping, and gathering; of boon days and sale
days; of shiftings and settlings; of hiring and term times they know
what to expect and will not be annoyed by grossness, or deterred by
affectations or their absence.

In these circumstances the word collector in Lakeland will find a
favourable condition for his operations if he know how to go about
it. Nor need he expect because so much of life is taken up with the
“struggle for existence” that the gentler and humaner phase of it will
not afford him specimens, “tender and true,” as in the most refined
circles.

An explanation is due to Cumbrians, who will find in this collection
words they did not expect, and will find omitted those they had
anticipated seeing. In many matters the two counties are indeed what
they are often termed—sisters. The words have largely been collected
in North Westmorland, but it must be borne in mind that Penrith, to
many, is to all intents as much as if it were in Westmorland, and to
have given one county only in the title would have been misleading and
far from accurate. This observation will apply to “Kendal side” of
Westmorland too.

Doctor Milner Fothergill says, “that up to Orton in Westmorland,
the speech is that of Lancashire; beyond its scar it is that of
Cumberland.” The genial, hearty doctor was too generous, and Cumberland
as well as Lancashire would disclaim his kindness. Likeness there is no
doubt towards the north, or towards the south, as the case may be, and
the fells mark a cleavage more distinct than some imaginary boundary of
counties, yet Westmorland men will never be prepared to be so quietly
effaced until a much greater extinction of dialect speech takes place
than has yet been effected, much as latter-day influences have done
towards modifying its most prominent features.

In the present work, such as it is, the help of Mr. Daniel Scott,
editor of the _Penrith Observer_, has to be acknowledged, also that of
“Northerner” in the same journal. The Rev. J. S. Davidson, the Rev. M.
B. Parker, Mr. R. E. Leech, M.A., Mr. John Harrison, Mr. Jas. Rennison,
Mr. Jos. Graves, Mr. Wm. Kerr, Miss Hunter, Miss Rudd, Mrs. Fauldrew,
Mr. A. Whitehead, and Mr. C. R. Farrer, with a number of correspondents
in various parts, whose names never transpired, have given generous
help to make the collection as comprehensive as possible. Also a very
able and representative body of critics was soon _en evidence_ to see
that it was as correct as possible. The Rev. Canon Thornley, the Rev.
John Wharton, and Professor Joseph Wright, M.A., were amongst those to
whose suggestions is due the fact of a permanent form being given to
what at first was only intended as a passing notice.

To Mr. Wilson, of Kendal, I am under the special obligation of the
adventurer who has help just when and where it is most wanted. From him
it has ever been an easy and pleasant task to obtain advice and counsel
without stint of pains or sympathy. With his aid and discrimination,
many otherwise insurmountable obstacles have been overcome. Without his
aid nothing of the present form could have been as much as attempted.

It is earnestly hoped that the rough and ready treatment of the
subject herein attempted will not in any way interfere with any of
the more thorough works dealing with the same subject now in course
of preparation by those capable of treating it from all standpoints
as specialists. Ours is the effort to present an inside view of the
dialect, marred no doubt by the leanings of prejudice, and for its
worst defects the only indulgence that is asked is that it may be
judged with that consideration kept in mind. It is a lover’s account,
and as such must be excused.

ABACK-O-BEYONT—The place from which comes nothing but mystery and
terror for barns; neea body’s bin an’ come back to say whar it ligs.

something that is set finely, and evenly balanced; ready and eager for
a fratch; a hat put on sideways; put out of temper; glib.


ACOCKINECKS—Where most youthful jockeys make their first attempt at
riding, namely, across the father’s neck; and later on in life as a
schoolboy’s game. To ride acockinecks is regarded as fine enough for
anyone.

ADDLE—Earn. In the sense of the word as now used in literature,
“addle” has none but an exactly opposite meaning. To earn; to turn to
good account; to make a living; it has nothing to do with barrenness,
corruption, or rottenness. How Addle, Addlepate, Addle-head,
Addle-brain, and so forth have sprung from so respectable an origin can
only be conjectured.


ADDLIN’, ADDLINS—Earning; wages. “Is ta addlin owt much?” “Siavin’s
good addlin.” “His addlins divn’t come to mich.” “He taks miast of his
addlins hiam tul his wife an’ barns.” Like Addle, Addlin’, and Addlins
are of good repute in Lakeland lore.

AGATEWARDS—Towards the gate. Said by some to be a relic from the times
when savage dogs rendered it necessary for the visitor to be “set” by

keeps the custom of “settin’ yan anudder agateards” alive, and is

PACE-EGGS—The Easter dues of the parish clerk paid in eggs. This custom

ale; perhaps because of the trick some pace-eggs had of going in that
direction and furnishing youthful diversion in the freaks of a few
drunken men.


PACE-EGGEN—Within the writer’s memory it was a common custom for the
children to go and beg eggs for the purpose of playing with them on
Easter Monday. Laiten piase-eggs, or laiken at piase-eggs. Further
back a few years, a custom existed of men going around to the houses
acting a kind of mummery, in which “Lord Nelson,” “Auld Tosspot,” and
“The Jolly Jack Tar,” were the principal characters. The introductory
doggerel ran after this fashion:

    “The first that comes in is Lord Nelson, you see,
    He’s a bunch of blue ribbons tied round on his knee,
    A star on his breast, like silver it shines,
    Ah hope you’ll remember it’s piase eggin times.”

THE END.

[Illustration]




 “It is always worth while to note down the erratic words or phrases
 which one meets with in any dialect.”




NOTES.

 “They may throw light on the meaning of other words, of the
 relationship of languages, or even on history itself.”
                                     _James Russell Lowell._


NOTE 1.—ALLAY.

The contention of several competent critics that this is but a form
of “Ah’lay,” or “Ah’ll lay,” was met by another from those intimately
associated with the dialect, and who only recognise one word in actual
use, and that with more of the sense of assurance or support, than of
defiance or daring conveyed in it. The vernacular form of the sporting
phrase “Ah’ll lay” is “Ah’ll lig.”


NOTE 2.—APODE.

Said to be only a form of _uphold_, _uphod_, _uphoad_, and as such
should be so spelt. On the other hand it is held by dialect speakers
that _apode_ is nearer the true pronunciation. A native of North
Westmorland would say of a contentious person, “he can uphod his awn,”
another would reply “Aye, Ah’ll apode it.” Of a great eater it would
be remarked, “he’s at a ter’ble gurt uphod,” and for answer would get
“Ah’ll apode it he is.” The _uphod_ of one may be his parish; of an
institution or establishment it is said to be great or small; and one
may be the _uphod_ of many things, in this sense _apode_ can be claimed
to have a distinct use.


NOTE 3.—CANTLAX.

Many words in this collection are said by eminent authorities to be
mere fabrications—that is, they are made up words by those using them
and have no derivation, history, or standing. This may be of that
class. It is included, because to the compiler it appears to be one of
a numerous family that carry with them the impression they are intended
to, directly and in the tone in which they are used. No information has
been obtainable beyond the fact that the word was used in one or two
instances by genuine Lakelanders, of whose dialect no question could be
raised.


NOTE 4.—CART, DURT, MURT, WURT.

_Cart_ (cannot), _Durt_ (do-not), _Murt_ (must-not), _Wurt_ (will-not),
like “garn,” met with strong objections from various writers qualified
to speak of the dialect in their districts. On the other hand a number
of persons supported their inclusion as being genuine forms in common
use. It may be the safer course to give them, and say they are in the
dialect in a restricted sense so far as radius and usage go.


NOTE 5.—CROWFOOT.

Apart from the use of Crowfoot as a botanical term for the genus
_Ranunculus_, it is also used to signify the bloom of the purple Orchis
in North Westmorland. As a term for Ranunculus or butter-cup, it is
seldom, if ever, used in that district.


NOTE 6.—DEAL.

(_i.e._ _Dale_) in the vernacular would be pronounced in all cases, as
if it were _di-yal_ with emphasis on the last syllable. Such a form,
however, would be sufficient to terrify even the most hardened reader
unless prepared by a previous study of phonetics.


NOTE 7.—DOGBERRY.

Given originally as the mountain ash and objected to. From the
correspondence it would seem to be safe to conclude that the berry of
the rowan or mountain ash, is in some districts termed “dogberry,” and
in the same locality the word is used for another shrub, the water
elder and its berries. Perhaps the use of “dogberry” for the former may
be due to carelessness in the matters pertaining to berries that have
small culinary value.


NOTE 8.—FAMISH.

On the ground that a mere local peculiarity of pronunciation does
not constitute a dialect word, forms like _famish_ were objected
to. They are included to demonstrate a feature in the dialect where
adjectives of a wholly inappropriate character are regularly used,
_e.g._ “A bonny auld shindy,” “A cruel fast trotter,” “A stinken good
mind,” “A famish gurt leer,” “A glorious good spree,” “Henious good
roads,”—_vide Combriana_, “A ter’ble romantic way o’ throwin’ oot his
feet,” “Sanctimonious as a ho’perth o’ treacle in a three quart jug,”
“Ah’s ter’ble fain ye’ve come,” “A tremendus habit o’ winkin at yan,”
“Parlish dear,” are common enough and seem to indicate a peculiarity
worthy of noting.


NOTE 9.—GARN, GOING.

This form met with strong objection. It appears in a Dialect Essay
in the West Cumberland Times, Christmas No. 1897, and several
correspondents vouched for its presence in the West Ward of
Westmorland. It will be safest to regard it as an extreme form and one
well illustrating the difficulty of rendering the dialect phonetically
with ordinary type.


NOTE 10.

In many words involving technical details, and others bordering on
what some readers might regard as coarseness, no attempt has been made
at defining or illustrating, but in dealing with them it has been the
aim to do it in the same colloquialism a native would affect. In a
work of the present character this latter purpose cannot fail to be as
interesting as details which would require many sciences to confirm.

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
