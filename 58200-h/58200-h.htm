<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>It is not necessary to speak many words in praise of such
an excellent book as “Lakeland Words,” it speaks for itself,
and must appeal to any and every Englishman who loves his
country and his native mother tongue.</p>

<p>It has often been said that the vocabulary of the ordinary
rustic is but poor and scanty, and it is just such books as Mr.
Kirkby’s which show how entirely false this statement is.
Mr. Kirkby, besides, is not a mere collector, come down from
London with his carpet bag to spend a few weeks in the north
to pick up material for “copy,” but he has been born and
bred in the country of which he writes, and he knows and
understands the dialect as no one from outside could. I have
had innumerable proofs of this from the vast amount of most
valuable material he has contributed to the English Dialect
Dictionary. There is a freshness and naturalness in his
material which is not found in books written by people
imperfectly acquainted with the people and the district.</p>

<p>In these days when the Board Schools teach the children
“Standard English,” and when locomotion is so easy that
people readily migrate from one part of the country to another,
dialects are rapidly decaying and losing their individuality,
and it will soon be impossible to compile local glossaries.
It is, therefore, not too much to say that Mr. Kirkby deserves
the hearty commendation and thanks of every lover of
English, for thus handing down to posterity such a faithful
portrait of the language of the Lakeland district, in all its
native freshness and richness.</p>

<p class="small">“Language is a solemn thing I said. It grows out of life—out of
its agonies, and ecstacies, its wants and its weariness. Every language is
a temple in which the soul of those who speak it is enshrined....
Foreigners who have talked a strange tongue half their lives return to the
language of their childhood in their dying hours. Gentlemen in fine
linen, and scholars in large libraries, taken by surprise, or in a careless
moment, will sometimes let slip a word they knew as boys in homespun,
and have not spoken since that time, but it lay there under all their
culture. That is one way you may know the country boys.”....</p>

<p>The following pages claim to do no more than to set forth
some of our best known dialect words, and to somewhat explain
or illustrate their use by a sentence in which the word
is introduced. So may not only the word be preserved, but
something also of unity of expression be maintained at the
same time.</p>

<p>Much of the matter has gone through the pages of the
<i>Penrith Observer</i>, in the form of weekly notes. These notes
were subject to some criticism. They were the means of
eliciting a good deal of help towards making the collection
more complete and accurate.</p>

<p>The method of spelling was frequently commented upon as involving an
unnecessary innovation. A short explanation will, it is hoped, enable
the reader to grasp it. Take such words as <i>face</i>, <i>race</i>, <i>place</i>,
with the long <i>a</i>. We pronounce them as <i>fi</i> + <i>as</i>, <i>ri</i> + <i>as</i>,
<i>pli</i> + <i>as</i>, with a short <i>i</i> sound, and the <i>a</i> short as in <i>as</i>.
Words like <i>master</i>, <i>plaster</i>, become <i>maister</i>, <i>plaister</i>, with the
<i>a</i> sounded as in <i>pay</i>. The long <i>o</i> sound is a pet aversion. <i>Home</i>
becomes <i>hi</i> + <i>am</i>, <i>boat</i> as if it were <i>boo</i> + <i>at</i>, <i>poke</i> takes
the form of <i>poo</i> + <i>ak</i>. Such words as <i>post</i> prove our consistency
and cause many a one to get laughed at for the hasty <i>o</i> we assign it
just as if it were <i>copy</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span></p>

<p>The deep sound of <i>oo</i> shows our perversity. For <i>ow</i> we give
it place every time, <i>hoo</i>, <i>thoo</i>, <i>doon</i>, <i>noo</i>, <i>coo</i>, and just
as readily depose it from its legitimate place in <i>boot</i>, <i>soot</i>,
<i>nook</i>, <i>book</i>, which in turn become <i>bi</i> + <i>ut</i>, <i>si</i> + <i>ut</i>, <i>ni</i>
+ <i>uk</i>, <i>bi</i> + <i>uk</i>. <i>Go</i>, <i>going</i>, <i>gone</i>, we make into <i>ga</i> (when
short), <i>gah</i>, <i>gahn</i>, <i>gi</i> + <i>an</i>, and in some extreme instances
almost <i>garn</i>. Final <i>ing</i> is too affected for us, so we drop it and
substitute <i>en</i>. <i>Quiet</i> we quietly convert into <i>whiat</i>, because <i>q</i>
is a pet aversion in all places with us. To give a hint as to the cause
of this does not come within our scope. But no one can come closely
into contact with the dialect without being struck with this aspect of
it. A word like <i>hope</i> we evade or turn it into <i>hooap</i> or <i>whop</i>, yet
<i>daup</i>, <i>cauf</i>, <i>mope</i>, <i>crope</i>, show that we can master the sound if
we wish, and stick to it. If we will not say <i>blue</i> except as <i>blew</i>,
we make up for it in <i>hoo</i> and <i>noo</i>. If the <i>r</i> is our aversion, we
can, as few others can, say <i>faddr</i>, <i>muddr</i>, <i>cluddr</i>.</p>

<p>Having banished the <i>ow</i> sound from most of its legitimate places in
the language, we put it in by way of amends where we can by “any manner
o’ means” do so. Thus we have <i>bowt</i> for <i>bolt</i> and <i>bought</i>; <i>browt</i>
for <i>brought</i>; <i>bowster</i> for <i>bolster</i>; <i>cowt</i> for <i>colt</i>; <i>thowt</i> for
<i>thought</i>; <i>dowter</i> for <i>daughter</i>; and so on.</p>

<p>In the present work no attempt is made to explain or
account for anything of a peculiar character in the dialect.
If language grows out of life, we are justified in regarding ours
as a type, and those who are most familiar with the life out of
which it has grown, will be most likely those to regard it most
leniently. They will know something of the social habits
which the fair and market, the smithy hearth, the shoemaker’s
shop are dominating factors in forming. They will understand
what it is to be concerned with cattle, and the elements, as
others are with more mighty affairs. Out of the exigencies of
ploughing, sowing, reaping, and gathering; of boon days and
sale days; of shiftings and settlings; of hiring and term times
they know what to expect and will not be annoyed by grossness,
or deterred by affectations or their absence.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the word collector in Lakeland will
find a favourable condition for his operations if he know how
to go about it. Nor need he expect because so much of life is
taken up with the “struggle for existence” that the gentler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
and humaner phase of it will not afford him specimens,
“tender and true,” as in the most refined circles.</p>

<p>An explanation is due to Cumbrians, who will find in this
collection words they did not expect, and will find omitted
those they had anticipated seeing. In many matters the two
counties are indeed what they are often termed—sisters. The
words have largely been collected in North Westmorland, but
it must be borne in mind that Penrith, to many, is to all
intents as much as if it were in Westmorland, and to have
given one county only in the title would have been misleading
and far from accurate. This observation will apply to
“Kendal side” of Westmorland too.</p>

<p>Doctor Milner Fothergill says, “that up to Orton in Westmorland,
the speech is that of Lancashire; beyond its scar it
is that of Cumberland.” The genial, hearty doctor was too
generous, and Cumberland as well as Lancashire would disclaim
his kindness. Likeness there is no doubt towards the
north, or towards the south, as the case may be, and the fells
mark a cleavage more distinct than some imaginary boundary
of counties, yet Westmorland men will never be prepared to
be so quietly effaced until a much greater extinction of dialect
speech takes place than has yet been effected, much as latter-day
influences have done towards modifying its most prominent
features.</p>

<p>In the present work, such as it is, the help of Mr. Daniel
Scott, editor of the <i>Penrith Observer</i>, has to be acknowledged,
also that of “Northerner” in the same journal. The Rev.
J. S. Davidson, the Rev. M. B. Parker, Mr. R. E. Leech, M.A.,
Mr. John Harrison, Mr. Jas. Rennison, Mr. Jos. Graves, Mr.
Wm. Kerr, Miss Hunter, Miss Rudd, Mrs. Fauldrew, Mr. A.
Whitehead, and Mr. C. R. Farrer, with a number of correspondents
in various parts, whose names never transpired, have
given generous help to make the collection as comprehensive as
possible. Also a very able and representative body of critics
was soon <i>en evidence</i> to see that it was as correct as possible.
The Rev. Canon Thornley, the Rev. John Wharton, and Professor
Joseph Wright, M.A., were amongst those to whose
suggestions is due the fact of a permanent form being given
to what at first was only intended as a passing notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span></p>

<p>To Mr. Wilson, of Kendal, I am under the special obligation
of the adventurer who has help just when and where it is
most wanted. From him it has ever been an easy and
pleasant task to obtain advice and counsel without stint of
pains or sympathy. With his aid and discrimination, many
otherwise insurmountable obstacles have been overcome.
Without his aid nothing of the present form could have been
as much as attempted.</p>

<p>It is earnestly hoped that the rough and ready treatment of
the subject herein attempted will not in any way interfere with
any of the more thorough works dealing with the same subject
now in course of preparation by those capable of treating it
from all standpoints as specialists. Ours is the effort to present
an inside view of the dialect, marred no doubt by the
leanings of prejudice, and for its worst defects the only
indulgence that is asked is that it may be judged with that
consideration kept in mind. It is a lover’s account, and as
such must be excused.</p>

<p class="hang">AARON’S ROD—It grows e’ t’ garden.</p>


<p class="hang">ABACK—Behind; in the absence of; over some land-mark or
another. Thus, a cap hangs up aback o’ t’ door; a tale
may be told about some one aback of his back; and
another comes frae aback o’ t’ fells.</p>


<p class="hang">ABACK-O-BEYONT—The place from which comes nothing
but mystery and terror for barns; neea body’s bin an’
come back to say whar it ligs.</p>


<p class="hang">ABIDE—Put up wi’; ah can’t abide mucky fooak.</p>


<p class="hang">ABREED—Level, equal, broadcast. They war walken o’
abreed.</p>


<p class="hang">ACOCK—Hay that is cocked up in “fiut cocks,” or, “gurt
cocks”; something that is set finely, and evenly balanced;
ready and eager for a fratch; a hat put on sideways; put
out of temper; glib.</p>


<p class="hang">ACOCKINECKS—Where most youthful jockeys make their
first attempt at riding, namely, across the father’s neck;
and later on in life as a schoolboy’s game. To ride
acockinecks is regarded as fine enough for anyone.</p>


<p class="hang">ACOS—For the reason; because. “What for dud thoo punch
at my shins?” “Acos Ah thowt Ah wad see what thoo
wad say if Ah dud.”</p>


<p class="hang">ACROSS—Met with. Ah com across an auld nebbur er tweea.</p>


<p class="hang">ACROOK—Crooked. When t’ maut gits intul a chap’s legs
an’ he gahs across t’ rooad he’s gaan acriukt.</p>


<p class="hang">ADDLE—Earn. In the sense of the word as now used in
literature, “addle” has none but an exactly opposite
meaning. To earn; to turn to good account; to make a
living; it has nothing to do with barrenness, corruption,
or rottenness. How Addle, Addlepate, Addle-head, Addle-brain,
and so forth have sprung from so respectable an
origin can only be conjectured.</p>


<p class="hang">ADDLIN’, ADDLINS—Earning; wages. “Is ta addlin owt
much?” “Siavin’s good addlin.” “His addlins divn’t
come to mich.” “He taks miast of his addlins hiam tul
his wife an’ barns.” Like Addle, Addlin’, and Addlins are

<p class="center small space-below">“It is always worth while to note down the erratic words or
phrases which one meets with in any dialect.”</p>




<h2 id="NOTES">NOTES.</h2>



<p class="center small space-above">“They may throw light on the meaning of other words, of the
relationship of languages, or even on history itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>—ALLAY.</p>

<p>The contention of several competent critics that this is but
a form of “Ah’lay,” or “Ah’ll lay,” was met by another from
those intimately associated with the dialect, and who only
recognise one word in actual use, and that with more of the
sense of assurance or support, than of defiance or daring conveyed
in it. The vernacular form of the sporting phrase
“Ah’ll lay” is “Ah’ll lig.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>—APODE.</p>

<p>Said to be only a form of <i>uphold</i>, <i>uphod</i>, <i>uphoad</i>, and as
such should be so spelt. On the other hand it is held by
dialect speakers that <i>apode</i> is nearer the true pronunciation.
A native of North Westmorland would say of a contentious
person, “he can uphod his awn,” another would reply “Aye,
Ah’ll apode it.” Of a great eater it would be remarked, “he’s
at a ter’ble gurt uphod,” and for answer would get “Ah’ll
apode it he is.” The <i>uphod</i> of one may be his parish; of an
institution or establishment it is said to be great or small;
and one may be the <i>uphod</i> of many things, in this sense <i>apode</i>
can be claimed to have a distinct use.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 3.</span>—CANTLAX.</p>

<p>Many words in this collection are said by eminent authorities
to be mere fabrications—that is, they are made up words by
those using them and have no derivation, history, or standing.
This may be of that class. It is included, because to the
compiler it appears to be one of a numerous family that carry
with them the impression they are intended to, directly and in
the tone in which they are used. No information has been
obtainable beyond the fact that the word was used in one or
two instances by genuine Lakelanders, of whose dialect no
question could be raised.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 4.</span>—CART, DURT, MURT, WURT.</p>

<p><i>Cart</i> (cannot), <i>Durt</i> (do-not), <i>Murt</i> (must-not), <i>Wurt</i> (will-not),
like “garn,” met with strong objections from various
writers qualified to speak of the dialect in their districts. On
the other hand a number of persons supported their inclusion
as being genuine forms in common use. It may be the safer
course to give them, and say they are in the dialect in a
restricted sense so far as radius and usage go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 5.</span>—CROWFOOT.</p>

<p>Apart from the use of Crowfoot as a botanical term for the
genus <i>Ranunculus</i>, it is also used to signify the bloom of the
purple Orchis in North Westmorland. As a term for Ranunculus
or butter-cup, it is seldom, if ever, used in that district.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 6.</span>—DEAL.</p>

<p>(<i>i.e.</i> <i>Dale</i>) in the vernacular would be pronounced in all cases,
as if it were <i>di-yal</i> with emphasis on the last syllable. Such
a form, however, would be sufficient to terrify even the most
hardened reader unless prepared by a previous study of
phonetics.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 7.</span>—DOGBERRY.</p>

<p>Given originally as the mountain ash and objected to. From
the correspondence it would seem to be safe to conclude that
the berry of the rowan or mountain ash, is in some districts
termed “dogberry,” and in the same locality the word is used
for another shrub, the water elder and its berries. Perhaps
the use of “dogberry” for the former may be due to carelessness
in the matters pertaining to berries that have small
culinary value.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 8.</span>—FAMISH.</p>

<p>On the ground that a mere local peculiarity of pronunciation
does not constitute a dialect word, forms like <i>famish</i> were
objected to. They are included to demonstrate a feature in
the dialect where adjectives of a wholly inappropriate character
are regularly used, <i>e.g.</i> “A bonny auld shindy,” “A cruel fast
trotter,” “A stinken good mind,” “A famish gurt leer,” “A
glorious good spree,” “Henious good roads,”—<i>vide Combriana</i>,
“A ter’ble romantic way o’ throwin’ oot his feet,” “Sanctimonious
as a ho’perth o’ treacle in a three quart jug,” “Ah’s
ter’ble fain ye’ve come,” “A tremendus habit o’ winkin at yan,”
“Parlish dear,” are common enough and seem to indicate a
peculiarity worthy of noting.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 9.</span>—GARN, GOING.</p>

<p>This form met with strong objection. It appears in a
Dialect Essay in the West Cumberland Times, Christmas No.
1897, and several correspondents vouched for its presence in
the West Ward of Westmorland. It will be safest to regard
it as an extreme form and one well illustrating the difficulty
of rendering the dialect phonetically with ordinary type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 10.</span></p>

<p>In many words involving technical details, and others
bordering on what some readers might regard as coarseness,
no attempt has been made at defining or illustrating, but in
dealing with them it has been the aim to do it in the same
colloquialism a native would affect. In a work of the present
character this latter purpose cannot fail to be as interesting
as details which would require many sciences to confirm.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
