<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>It is not necessary to speak many words in praise of such
an excellent book as “Lakeland Words,” it speaks for itself,
and must appeal to any and every Englishman who loves his
country and his native mother tongue.</p>

<p>It has often been said that the vocabulary of the ordinary
rustic is but poor and scanty, and it is just such books as Mr.
Kirkby’s which show how entirely false this statement is.
Mr. Kirkby, besides, is not a mere collector, come down from
London with his carpet bag to spend a few weeks in the north
to pick up material for “copy,” but he has been born and
bred in the country of which he writes, and he knows and
understands the dialect as no one from outside could. I have
had innumerable proofs of this from the vast amount of most
valuable material he has contributed to the English Dialect
Dictionary. There is a freshness and naturalness in his
material which is not found in books written by people
imperfectly acquainted with the people and the district.</p>

<p>In these days when the Board Schools teach the children
“Standard English,” and when locomotion is so easy that
people readily migrate from one part of the country to another,
dialects are rapidly decaying and losing their individuality,
and it will soon be impossible to compile local glossaries.
It is, therefore, not too much to say that Mr. Kirkby deserves
the hearty commendation and thanks of every lover of
English, for thus handing down to posterity such a faithful
portrait of the language of the Lakeland district, in all its
native freshness and richness.</p>

<p class="small">“Language is a solemn thing I said. It grows out of life—out of
its agonies, and ecstacies, its wants and its weariness. Every language is
a temple in which the soul of those who speak it is enshrined....
Foreigners who have talked a strange tongue half their lives return to the
language of their childhood in their dying hours. Gentlemen in fine
linen, and scholars in large libraries, taken by surprise, or in a careless
moment, will sometimes let slip a word they knew as boys in homespun,
and have not spoken since that time, but it lay there under all their
culture. That is one way you may know the country boys.”....</p>

<i>Oliver Wendell Holmes.</i></p>

<h2 id="EXPLANATORY">EXPLANATORY.</h2>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The following pages claim to do no more than to set forth
some of our best known dialect words, and to somewhat explain
or illustrate their use by a sentence in which the word
is introduced. So may not only the word be preserved, but
something also of unity of expression be maintained at the
same time.</p>

<p>Much of the matter has gone through the pages of the
<i>Penrith Observer</i>, in the form of weekly notes. These notes
were subject to some criticism. They were the means of
eliciting a good deal of help towards making the collection
more complete and accurate.</p>

<p>The method of spelling was frequently commented upon as involving an
unnecessary innovation. A short explanation will, it is hoped, enable
the reader to grasp it. Take such words as <i>face</i>, <i>race</i>, <i>place</i>,
with the long <i>a</i>. We pronounce them as <i>fi</i> + <i>as</i>, <i>ri</i> + <i>as</i>,
<i>pli</i> + <i>as</i>, with a short <i>i</i> sound, and the <i>a</i> short as in <i>as</i>.
Words like <i>master</i>, <i>plaster</i>, become <i>maister</i>, <i>plaister</i>, with the
<i>a</i> sounded as in <i>pay</i>. The long <i>o</i> sound is a pet aversion. <i>Home</i>
becomes <i>hi</i> + <i>am</i>, <i>boat</i> as if it were <i>boo</i> + <i>at</i>, <i>poke</i> takes
the form of <i>poo</i> + <i>ak</i>. Such words as <i>post</i> prove our consistency
and cause many a one to get laughed at for the hasty <i>o</i> we assign it
just as if it were <i>copy</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span></p>

<p>The deep sound of <i>oo</i> shows our perversity. For <i>ow</i> we give
it place every time, <i>hoo</i>, <i>thoo</i>, <i>doon</i>, <i>noo</i>, <i>coo</i>, and just
as readily depose it from its legitimate place in <i>boot</i>, <i>soot</i>,
<i>nook</i>, <i>book</i>, which in turn become <i>bi</i> + <i>ut</i>, <i>si</i> + <i>ut</i>, <i>ni</i>
+ <i>uk</i>, <i>bi</i> + <i>uk</i>. <i>Go</i>, <i>going</i>, <i>gone</i>, we make into <i>ga</i> (when
short), <i>gah</i>, <i>gahn</i>, <i>gi</i> + <i>an</i>, and in some extreme instances
almost <i>garn</i>. Final <i>ing</i> is too affected for us, so we drop it and
substitute <i>en</i>. <i>Quiet</i> we quietly convert into <i>whiat</i>, because <i>q</i>
is a pet aversion in all places with us. To give a hint as to the cause
of this does not come within our scope. But no one can come closely
into contact with the dialect without being struck with this aspect of
it. A word like <i>hope</i> we evade or turn it into <i>hooap</i> or <i>whop</i>, yet
<i>daup</i>, <i>cauf</i>, <i>mope</i>, <i>crope</i>, show that we can master the sound if
we wish, and stick to it. If we will not say <i>blue</i> except as <i>blew</i>,
we make up for it in <i>hoo</i> and <i>noo</i>. If the <i>r</i> is our aversion, we
can, as few others can, say <i>faddr</i>, <i>muddr</i>, <i>cluddr</i>.</p>

<p>Having banished the <i>ow</i> sound from most of its legitimate places in
the language, we put it in by way of amends where we can by “any manner
o’ means” do so. Thus we have <i>bowt</i> for <i>bolt</i> and <i>bought</i>; <i>browt</i>
for <i>brought</i>; <i>bowster</i> for <i>bolster</i>; <i>cowt</i> for <i>colt</i>; <i>thowt</i> for
<i>thought</i>; <i>dowter</i> for <i>daughter</i>; and so on.</p>

<p>In the present work no attempt is made to explain or
account for anything of a peculiar character in the dialect.
If language grows out of life, we are justified in regarding ours
as a type, and those who are most familiar with the life out of
which it has grown, will be most likely those to regard it most
leniently. They will know something of the social habits
which the fair and market, the smithy hearth, the shoemaker’s
shop are dominating factors in forming. They will understand
what it is to be concerned with cattle, and the elements, as
others are with more mighty affairs. Out of the exigencies of
ploughing, sowing, reaping, and gathering; of boon days and
sale days; of shiftings and settlings; of hiring and term times
they know what to expect and will not be annoyed by grossness,
or deterred by affectations or their absence.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the word collector in Lakeland will
find a favourable condition for his operations if he know how
to go about it. Nor need he expect because so much of life is
taken up with the “struggle for existence” that the gentler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
and humaner phase of it will not afford him specimens,
“tender and true,” as in the most refined circles.</p>

<p>An explanation is due to Cumbrians, who will find in this
collection words they did not expect, and will find omitted
those they had anticipated seeing. In many matters the two
counties are indeed what they are often termed—sisters. The
words have largely been collected in North Westmorland, but
it must be borne in mind that Penrith, to many, is to all
intents as much as if it were in Westmorland, and to have
given one county only in the title would have been misleading
and far from accurate. This observation will apply to
“Kendal side” of Westmorland too.</p>

<p>Doctor Milner Fothergill says, “that up to Orton in Westmorland,
the speech is that of Lancashire; beyond its scar it
is that of Cumberland.” The genial, hearty doctor was too
generous, and Cumberland as well as Lancashire would disclaim
his kindness. Likeness there is no doubt towards the
north, or towards the south, as the case may be, and the fells
mark a cleavage more distinct than some imaginary boundary
of counties, yet Westmorland men will never be prepared to
be so quietly effaced until a much greater extinction of dialect
speech takes place than has yet been effected, much as latter-day
influences have done towards modifying its most prominent
features.</p>

<p>In the present work, such as it is, the help of Mr. Daniel
Scott, editor of the <i>Penrith Observer</i>, has to be acknowledged,
also that of “Northerner” in the same journal. The Rev.
J. S. Davidson, the Rev. M. B. Parker, Mr. R. E. Leech, M.A.,
Mr. John Harrison, Mr. Jas. Rennison, Mr. Jos. Graves, Mr.
Wm. Kerr, Miss Hunter, Miss Rudd, Mrs. Fauldrew, Mr. A.
Whitehead, and Mr. C. R. Farrer, with a number of correspondents
in various parts, whose names never transpired, have
given generous help to make the collection as comprehensive as
possible. Also a very able and representative body of critics
was soon <i>en evidence</i> to see that it was as correct as possible.
The Rev. Canon Thornley, the Rev. John Wharton, and Professor
Joseph Wright, M.A., were amongst those to whose
suggestions is due the fact of a permanent form being given
to what at first was only intended as a passing notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span></p>

<p>To Mr. Wilson, of Kendal, I am under the special obligation
of the adventurer who has help just when and where it is
most wanted. From him it has ever been an easy and
pleasant task to obtain advice and counsel without stint of
pains or sympathy. With his aid and discrimination, many
otherwise insurmountable obstacles have been overcome.
Without his aid nothing of the present form could have been
as much as attempted.</p>

<p>It is earnestly hoped that the rough and ready treatment of
the subject herein attempted will not in any way interfere with
any of the more thorough works dealing with the same subject
now in course of preparation by those capable of treating it
from all standpoints as specialists. Ours is the effort to present
an inside view of the dialect, marred no doubt by the
leanings of prejudice, and for its worst defects the only
indulgence that is asked is that it may be judged with that
consideration kept in mind. It is a lover’s account, and as
such must be excused.</p>

<h2 id="LAKELAND_WORDS_AND_SAYINGS">LAKELAND WORDS AND SAYINGS.</h2>

<hr class="small" />

<p class="hang">AARON’S ROD—It grows e’ t’ garden.</p>


<p class="hang">ABACK—Behind; in the absence of; over some land-mark or
another. Thus, a cap hangs up aback o’ t’ door; a tale
may be told about some one aback of his back; and
another comes frae aback o’ t’ fells.</p>


<p class="hang">ABACK-O-BEYONT—The place from which comes nothing
but mystery and terror for barns; neea body’s bin an’
come back to say whar it ligs.</p>


<p class="hang">ABIDE—Put up wi’; ah can’t abide mucky fooak.</p>


<p class="hang">ABREED—Level, equal, broadcast. They war walken o’
abreed.</p>


<p class="hang">ACOCK—Hay that is cocked up in “fiut cocks,” or, “gurt
cocks”; something that is set finely, and evenly balanced;
ready and eager for a fratch; a hat put on sideways; put
out of temper; glib.</p>


<p class="hang">ACOCKINECKS—Where most youthful jockeys make their
first attempt at riding, namely, across the father’s neck;
and later on in life as a schoolboy’s game. To ride
acockinecks is regarded as fine enough for anyone.</p>


<p class="hang">ACOS—For the reason; because. “What for dud thoo punch
at my shins?” “Acos Ah thowt Ah wad see what thoo
wad say if Ah dud.”</p>


<p class="hang">ACROSS—Met with. Ah com across an auld nebbur er tweea.</p>


<p class="hang">ACROOK—Crooked. When t’ maut gits intul a chap’s legs
an’ he gahs across t’ rooad he’s gaan acriukt.</p>


<p class="hang">ADDLE—Earn. In the sense of the word as now used in
literature, “addle” has none but an exactly opposite
meaning. To earn; to turn to good account; to make a
living; it has nothing to do with barrenness, corruption,
or rottenness. How Addle, Addlepate, Addle-head, Addle-brain,
and so forth have sprung from so respectable an
origin can only be conjectured.</p>


<p class="hang">ADDLIN’, ADDLINS—Earning; wages. “Is ta addlin owt
much?” “Siavin’s good addlin.” “His addlins divn’t
come to mich.” “He taks miast of his addlins hiam tul
his wife an’ barns.” Like Addle, Addlin’, and Addlins are
of good repute in Lakeland lore.</p>


<p class="hang">AFRONT—Before. He was on afront.</p>


<p class="hang">AFORE—In front of; before. A gurt dub o’ watter afooar
t’ door. Winter’s come afooar it time.</p>


<p class="hang">AFORETIME—Previously: the old days. They’d hed some
bother afooartime about t’ sheep an’ t’ dykes. Afooartime
yan used ta be prood o’ some good poddish fer yan’s
supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>


<p class="hang">AFOREHAND—Done before; he had his rent ready afooarhand.</p>


<p class="hang">AGREE—Amiss, crossways. T’ auld piase-eggers wad sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If ye give us nowt we’ll tak nowt agree,</div>
<div class="verse">But we’ll gang and sail owld England’s sea.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p class="hang">AGGLE AN’ JAGGLE—To higgle over a bargain; a bit o’
fendin an’ priuvin’ ower owt.</p>


<p class="hang">AGATE—Started; abusing; out of the way. “Hev ye gitten
agiat mowin’?” T’auld beggar’s allus agiat o’ yan er
anudder on us blackin’ an’ gaan on. Ye’ve gian a lang
way agiat.</p>


<p class="hang">AGATEWARDS—Towards the gate. Said by some to be a
relic from the times when savage dogs rendered it necessary
for the visitor to be “set” by “t’ fauld yat.” Another
and an older reason than savage dogs still keeps the custom
of “settin’ yan anudder agateards” alive, and is
likely to do, so long as lads and lasses care for one
another’s company.</p>


<p class="hang">AIBLINS—Possibly. Will ye gang o’ Sunday? Aiblins ah
may.</p>


<p class="hang">AH-WOOA-GE-HEDDER-COME-UP—A nag ’at doesn’t
understand its orders is apt ta git t’ whup. We yance
watched a chap plewin, an’ he said, “Ah-wooa-ge-hedder-come-up”
till he was stalled, then he let flee wi a clot,
coad t’ nag a fiual, an’ telt it ta liuk an see what seck

<p class="hang">AHINT—Behind. Allus keep ahint a shutter. Thoo can git

<p class="hang">AJYE—O’ yah side as some fooak weear their hats.</p>


<p class="hang">AIM, AIMED—Intend, intended. We didn’t aim ye to know.
Ah’d aimed ye to stop an’ hev a cup o’ tea.</p>


<p class="hang">AIR, AIRED—To warm or dry. Air t’ bed; air mi shirt. A

a custom existed of men going around to the houses acting
a kind of mummery, in which “Lord Nelson,” “Auld
Tosspot,” and “The Jolly Jack Tar,” were the principal
characters. The introductory doggerel ran after this
fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p class="center small space-below">“It is always worth while to note down the erratic words or
phrases which one meets with in any dialect.”</p>




<h2 id="NOTES">NOTES.</h2>



<p class="center small space-above">“They may throw light on the meaning of other words, of the
relationship of languages, or even on history itself.”</p>
<p class="right small"><i>James Russell Lowell.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>—ALLAY.</p>

<p>The contention of several competent critics that this is but
a form of “Ah’lay,” or “Ah’ll lay,” was met by another from
those intimately associated with the dialect, and who only
recognise one word in actual use, and that with more of the
sense of assurance or support, than of defiance or daring conveyed
in it. The vernacular form of the sporting phrase
“Ah’ll lay” is “Ah’ll lig.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>—APODE.</p>

<p>Said to be only a form of <i>uphold</i>, <i>uphod</i>, <i>uphoad</i>, and as
such should be so spelt. On the other hand it is held by
dialect speakers that <i>apode</i> is nearer the true pronunciation.
A native of North Westmorland would say of a contentious
person, “he can uphod his awn,” another would reply “Aye,
Ah’ll apode it.” Of a great eater it would be remarked, “he’s
at a ter’ble gurt uphod,” and for answer would get “Ah’ll
apode it he is.” The <i>uphod</i> of one may be his parish; of an
institution or establishment it is said to be great or small;
and one may be the <i>uphod</i> of many things, in this sense <i>apode</i>
can be claimed to have a distinct use.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 3.</span>—CANTLAX.</p>

<p>Many words in this collection are said by eminent authorities
to be mere fabrications—that is, they are made up words by
those using them and have no derivation, history, or standing.
This may be of that class. It is included, because to the
compiler it appears to be one of a numerous family that carry
with them the impression they are intended to, directly and in
the tone in which they are used. No information has been
obtainable beyond the fact that the word was used in one or
two instances by genuine Lakelanders, of whose dialect no
question could be raised.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 4.</span>—CART, DURT, MURT, WURT.</p>

<p><i>Cart</i> (cannot), <i>Durt</i> (do-not), <i>Murt</i> (must-not), <i>Wurt</i> (will-not),
like “garn,” met with strong objections from various
writers qualified to speak of the dialect in their districts. On
the other hand a number of persons supported their inclusion
as being genuine forms in common use. It may be the safer
course to give them, and say they are in the dialect in a
restricted sense so far as radius and usage go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 5.</span>—CROWFOOT.</p>

<p>Apart from the use of Crowfoot as a botanical term for the
genus <i>Ranunculus</i>, it is also used to signify the bloom of the
purple Orchis in North Westmorland. As a term for Ranunculus
or butter-cup, it is seldom, if ever, used in that district.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 6.</span>—DEAL.</p>

<p>(<i>i.e.</i> <i>Dale</i>) in the vernacular would be pronounced in all cases,
as if it were <i>di-yal</i> with emphasis on the last syllable. Such
a form, however, would be sufficient to terrify even the most
hardened reader unless prepared by a previous study of
phonetics.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 7.</span>—DOGBERRY.</p>

<p>Given originally as the mountain ash and objected to. From
the correspondence it would seem to be safe to conclude that
the berry of the rowan or mountain ash, is in some districts
termed “dogberry,” and in the same locality the word is used
for another shrub, the water elder and its berries. Perhaps
the use of “dogberry” for the former may be due to carelessness
in the matters pertaining to berries that have small
culinary value.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 8.</span>—FAMISH.</p>

<p>On the ground that a mere local peculiarity of pronunciation
does not constitute a dialect word, forms like <i>famish</i> were
objected to. They are included to demonstrate a feature in
the dialect where adjectives of a wholly inappropriate character
are regularly used, <i>e.g.</i> “A bonny auld shindy,” “A cruel fast
trotter,” “A stinken good mind,” “A famish gurt leer,” “A
glorious good spree,” “Henious good roads,”—<i>vide Combriana</i>,
“A ter’ble romantic way o’ throwin’ oot his feet,” “Sanctimonious
as a ho’perth o’ treacle in a three quart jug,” “Ah’s
ter’ble fain ye’ve come,” “A tremendus habit o’ winkin at yan,”
“Parlish dear,” are common enough and seem to indicate a
peculiarity worthy of noting.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 9.</span>—GARN, GOING.</p>

<p>This form met with strong objection. It appears in a
Dialect Essay in the West Cumberland Times, Christmas No.
1897, and several correspondents vouched for its presence in
the West Ward of Westmorland. It will be safest to regard
it as an extreme form and one well illustrating the difficulty
of rendering the dialect phonetically with ordinary type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note 10.</span></p>

<p>In many words involving technical details, and others
bordering on what some readers might regard as coarseness,
no attempt has been made at defining or illustrating, but in
dealing with them it has been the aim to do it in the same
colloquialism a native would affect. In a work of the present
character this latter purpose cannot fail to be as interesting
as details which would require many sciences to confirm.</p>
